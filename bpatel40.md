Forking creates an independent copy of a repository under your username, useful for experimentation and development without affecting the original project.

Cloning downloads the entire contents of a repository from a remote server to your local machine, enabling you to work on the code locally and contribute changes back to the repository.

Branching enables you to diverge from the main codebase, allowing you to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation from the main development line, and merge your changes back in when they are complete and tested.
