git clone: This gives you everything from the repo that you are cloning. It has the files, the master branch, the other branches, and everything else in the repo. You can commit to this clone, and then push changes to the remote repo.

git fork: Using this command essentially creates one's own copy of the repo into their own a repo account. Once they finish changes, they can send a pull request to have their changes accepted into the main repo.

git branch: Branches allow you to edit stuff without the changing anything in the master branch until you want to merge the changes you've made with the master. It is largely used for working on different features of a project so changes can be made incrementally and aspects of a project can be worked on in a specialized manner.
