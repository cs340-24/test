To fork a repository is create your own repository that is a copy of an existing repository. When you make changes to the fork, you can make pull requests to apply those changes to the original repository.
To clone a repository is to download a copy of it to your computer in order to edit files and push the edits back to the repository.
A branch of a repository is a section of the repository that is separate from the other branches, making it easy to separate different parts of a project so they can't conflict with each other.
