Fork - Creates a copy of a repository for your GitHub account. This copy can be modified without affecting the original repository. 
      Updates can be made to the original repository using pull requests. The forked repository is stored on the GitHub server and can be synced with the original repository because the two stay connected.

Clone - Creates a copy of a repository on your local machine. This allows work to be done on the repository while offline. It can still be synced with the original when connected to the internet.

Branch - A copy of a repository that remains within the repository. Modifications can be made without affecting the main branch. 
        These modifications can update the main branch when it is merged with the copy branch.
