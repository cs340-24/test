Forking a repository creates a brand new version of the codebase that can only be updated and edited by those who have access to the fork. Cloning a repository, means the cloned repository is still connected and shared with all developers who used the original repository and they can still work on, update and commit on that version. Branching a repository creates a branch from a specific version of the repository that can be commited on and updated separately from main, but can still be seen by all developers.
