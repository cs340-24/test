Github fork is when you make a new repository that is able to share code and other visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository. They can be used to express ideas or changes in open source projects before they are proposed back to the upstream repository.

Git clone is used to download an existing Git repository to a local machine. You will have full blown local copies of all files so you can work on the project as you see fit. The original repository remains located on a remote server such as on GitHub.

Git branch allows you to create, list, name, and delete branches which are essentially pointers to a snapshot of your changes. Whenever you make changes (add features, fix bugs, etc) a new branch is made to reflect your changes.
