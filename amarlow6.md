Explain the difference between GitHub fork, git clone, and git branch

A github fork is a vitural copy of a repo on github that you are allowed to make changes too and request to push back into the original repo

A github clone is a local copy of a repo that you can make changes to and request to push back into the original

A github branch is any other virtual version of a repo that has had changes made to it that do not align up with the main branch. These can be carefully merges back into the main branch
