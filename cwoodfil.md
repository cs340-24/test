Fork: Allows you to copy a project and work on it without altering the repository from which you copied it.

Clone: Downloads a repository to your local machine from a remote host (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.)

Branch: Creates a snapshot of the code and allows you to alter it before being merged into the original branch. This helps to filter out unstable code before it makes it into the final project.
