GIT FORK
Forking is an operation used by GitHub to create a copy of an entire
remote repository. It is primarily used to contribute to someone else's
project. Changes are made locally, pushed to the forked version of the
repository, then merged with the original repository after a pull 
request is made.

GIT CLONE
Creates a local copy of a repository hosted on GitHub. It copies all of the
files and branches of the remote repository.

GIT BRANCH
Used to create different versions of the codebase for specific tasks (e.g. 
experimental, development, stable, etc.) This is done so that changes can
be made to the existing code without disrupting the current working version
of the code. Branching doesn't copy the codebase, it just references 
different commits, so it isn't a complete duplicate of the current code.
