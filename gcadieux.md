Fork: A forked repository is independent of the original repo is was forked from. We can make pull request from our forked repository to contribute to some sort of project or code in the original repo.
Clone: A cloned repo simply allows us to manipulate the files of a repo from our local machine and then push these changes to the github repo.
Branch: A branch is dependent on the original repo, unlike a fork. It is not necessarily its own repository. Branches are often used to work on part of a project and then merge the changes back into the main branch once resolved.
