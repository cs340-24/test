Github Fork is a Github function (not a git command) which duplicates a Github 
repository. It is common to fork a repository to have a copy of one's own. The
repository can then be cloned to one's personal machine.

Git Clone copies an entire git repository including its branches and entire
revision history. One common use is to download a repository hosted on Github 
or another location to one's local machine for work.
 
Git Branch allows the user to introduce a new branch to a git repository. 
Modifications made to the repository can be committed to that branch without
affecting other branches. Eventually, if desired, the branch can be merged.
