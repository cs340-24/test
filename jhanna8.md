Forks "allow for collaboration even when direct participation is not possible."
By forking a project, you get an identical copy of the project as it was when
you forked it. Any changes you make to this new repository do not affect the
forked (original) repository. In order to update the original repository with
changes you made to your new repository (that you got by forking the original),
you submit a pull request, in hopes that the pull request will be accepted and
therefore merged into the original repository.

Forks are used when a person wants to collaborate on a project but does not
have write access to it, and therefore cannot make changes to the original
repository. It gives them their own copy of the repository to make changes to,
and they can submit a pull request to the original repository to propose that
changes they made (to their copy of the original) be merged (incorporated) into
the original repository.

Branches give one the ability to do work on a repository in isolation from
changes made by others following the branch. When you branch a repository, you
break off from the main line of development, and so any changes that you make
affect only your newly created branch, and not the master (or main) branch, or
whatever branch you branched from, until you decide to merge your changes with
that branch, at which point the two branches will both point to the same state
of the project, and the branch you created can then be deleted if it is no
longer needed.
