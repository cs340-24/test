Github Fork: Copying a repository to your account remotely, which you can modify without affecting the original repository. You can request submit pulls so that the original repository has your changes included.

Git Clone: Instead of copying a repository remotely, cloning makes a copy on your local device. Any changes made
on the clone will change the original repository. 

Git Branch: New version of the main repository which allows you to work on updates for a project without affecting
what work is already there. When you have finished making updates you can merge the branch with main to include the
updates.
