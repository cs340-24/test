**Github fork:**
Primarily used for copying another repository to your own system which is independent of the original repo, 
although there is still a link. By linked, I mean that you can request for your own code adjustments and additions 
to be pulled to the original repo after you have made the commits in your fork of the repository. 
Most importantly, you can make changes in your fork without it affecting the original repository.

**Git clone:**
Git clone is used to create a copy of the remote repository on your own local device. 
This will be directly connected to the primary repo, so you could not commit and push changes without 
it affecting the live version of the code unless you make these changes inside of a branch which I discuss next.

**Git branch:**
Git branch is used to work on new additions, bug fixes, or any other modifications to the codebase without having 
to worry about breaking something. You can create a "branch" and go into the branch (which initially creates a 
copy of the current codebase upon creation) to make the code modifications. You can merge the main branch and 
the new branch after you're satisfied with the code in order to catch the master branch up to the most recent version of the code.
