A github fork is when you're making a new repository and it is able to work on the main branch of the code. If it is approved, it can go and be merged into the main code. Git clone is used when you want to copy an open source repo to any machine (local or ssh). Git branch lets you work on branches that are "snapshots" of what the code looked like AT THAT TIME. When you make a new change, the branch will be "diff'd" to see the changes.
