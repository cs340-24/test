Fork: A fork is used to copy a whole repository for yourself. It is typically used when you want to contribute to an open source project.
Clone:Cloning is when you make a copy of the repository to your local machine, but it is not for an open-source project. In this, you can edit the files independently.
Branch: Branches enable you to work on the code without disrupting the original copy, where you can later merge it back after the changes have been checked out.
